This library is intended primarily to reduce boilerplate that OpenGL imposes on the user by employing code generation from user defined structures, getting as close as one can get to making working with OpenGL declarative.

Who is this for?
-------------------
Anyone who normally would have wanted to use OpenGL in D, but wanted a safer and less repetitive way of working with OpenGL, while retaining all the power of OpenGL with as minimal overhead as possible.
Naturally, working with OpenGL directly would have the least overhead possible, but this library is intended to make common errors when working with OpenGL non-existent, as well as erase boilerplate.
